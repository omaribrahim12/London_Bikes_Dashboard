# London_Bikes_Dashboard
Welcome to my third Tableau dashboard! This iteration is more advanced and integrated, and I thoroughly enjoyed working on it, especially as a cyclist myself. This dashboard delves into London bike sharing, utilizing a Kaggle dataset. You can find the dataset link at the end of the post.

The dashboard encompasses data from 2015-01-04 to 2017-01-03, focusing on the number of cyclists in London and related factors such as temperature, humidity, and seasons.

It highlights the most common times cyclists prefer to ride within a 24-hour period, considering various weather conditions and different seasons.

Within the dashboard, I've included graphs that provide detailed insights. Moreover, I've ensured that all the graphs and the heatmap are interconnected, allowing for a comprehensive view of the dashboard. Prior to creating the dashboard, I implemented a simple code using Python to download and extract the data using the Kaggle API. I then saved it as an Excel file to utilize it in Tableau. Additionally, I enhanced the clarity of headers by using a dictionary.
